## Core Philosophy: Fast Prototyping

## Implementation Rules

### Only Implement What's Asked
- Implement **exactly** what the user requests, nothing more
- If dependencies are explicitly required, add them; otherwise, skip
- No speculative features or premature abstractions
- Code should be production-ready, not prototype-quality

### Propose, Don't Assume
When identifying useful improvements beyond the explicit request:
- **DO NOT implement automatically**
- **Propose** as a numbered plan:
```
Proposals:
(1) Extract ContractAnalyzer logic into base agent class
    - Purpose: Reusable for all agent types (contract, research, negotiation)
    - Estimated LOC: ~80 lines
    - Benefit: DRY principle for future agents
(2) Add probability calculation caching
    - Purpose: Reduce API calls for repeated contract analyses
    - Estimated LOC: ~30 lines
```

User approves explicitly (e.g., "yes to 1, no to 2") before implementation.

When suggesting code changes or implementations, explain in natural language rather than writing code directly.

### Code Quality Standards
- **Readable and maintainable**: Clear, self-documenting code
- **No premature optimization**: Optimize only when there's a proven need
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Always check existing code before writing new logic
- **Smart abstractions**: Create abstractions when they reduce complexity, not for theoretical reuse
- **Clean interfaces**: Simple, well-encapsulated APIs with minimal parameters

### Service/Utils Pattern
- **Always search @backend/services/ and @backend/utils/** before creating new utilities
- Centralize shared logic (API calls, data processing, formatting)
- Keep services focused: one clear responsibility per service
- Utilities should be pure functions when possible

## Design for Maintainability
- Code should be understandable without excessive context
- Favor explicit over clever solutions
- Minimize coupling between modules
- Each component should have a single, clear purpose
- Think: "Will this make sense to someone reading it in 6 months?"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Duplicating logic across files
- ❌ Creating abstractions "just in case"
- ❌ Over-complicated class hierarchies
- ❌ God classes that do everything
- ❌ Unclear naming or hidden side effects

**Build it right the first time. Clean, modular, and maintainable.**

Before writing any code, always check existing codebase for reusable patterns and shared functionality. Code everything in English. But user inputs/interfaces should be in French.
